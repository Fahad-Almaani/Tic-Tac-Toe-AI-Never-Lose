# Tic-Tac-Toe-AI-Never-Lose
## A Tic Tac Toe game where the AI never loses; all games will end with either a computer win or a tie.

### Introduction
In this program, we implement the minimax algorithm to create an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe AI. The AI always finds the best move possible, ensuring that it never loses a game.

### Dependencies
To run this code, you need to install the following libraries:
- [pygame](https://pygame.org/)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pygame numpy
```

### How To Use
1. Run the code.
2. You always play first, and then the computer will make its move.
3. The game board will display green if you win, red if you lose, and gray for a tie.
4. To reset the game, simply click `R`.

Note: This implementation is not original; the algorithm and idea have been available on the internet for a long time. Feel free to use this code in any context.
